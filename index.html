            <p>Well, mitigate means to make something less severe, serious, or painful. It's the article about how nanotechnology can help mitigate the global warming. Nanotechnology has a significant potential to solve or mitigate the problem of global warming. However, one has to approach this issue carefully. Nanotechnology invariably involves use of nanomaterials (nanocatalysts, nanomembranes, nanoparticles, aerogel etc.)</p>
